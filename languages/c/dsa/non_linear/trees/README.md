# Trees

## Building

Compile a single implementation:

```bash
zig build avl_tree # Builds the avl_tree executable
zig build binary_tree # Builds the binary_tree executable
zig build binary_search_tree # Builds the binary_search_tree executable
zig build all # Builds all tree implementations
```

Build all implementations at once:

```bash
zig build all
```

## Running

Executes the binary

```bash
zig build run avl_tree # Runs the avl_tree executable
zig build run binary_search_tree # Runs the binary_search_tree executable
zig build run binary_tree # Runs the binary_tree executable
```
